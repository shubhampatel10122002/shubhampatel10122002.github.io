I am an MSCS graduate student at New York University, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. I'm dedicated to staying at the forefront of technology trends and continuously expanding my knowledge in computer science, software development, and machine learning. My goal is to drive innovation and create impact on a bigger scale.

My fascination for computer science opriginates from my passion to solve problems and puzzles. Something about our problem solving ability as humans amazes me. For the same reason, I’ve continuously explored the field of machine learning in the hope to see if they could match human intelligence. In particular, the evolution of human communication has left me enthralled and I’m currently exploring natural language processing technologies to help computers mimic this. 

As a former software development engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and a passion for technology, I bring 2 years of experience in software development, algorithms, and machine learning My academic background, coupled with practical industry experience, has equipped me with the skills to design and implement complex software solutions, and solve challenging technical problems.
