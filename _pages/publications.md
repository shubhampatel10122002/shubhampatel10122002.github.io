Architected and pre-trained a RoBERTa model on over 70 million SMILES strings, employing masked language modeling to capture molecular embeddings with high-dimensional contextual dependencies. Here we achieved a prediction accuracy of 98%—capturing intricate molecular structure representations. This pre-training involved careful optimization of the transformer’s multi-head attention layers and positional encoding schemes to encode SMILES strings effectively, enabling the model to learn both localized and extended dependencies across complex chemical sequences.

For downstream fine-tuning, I adapted the model to predict surface tension values—a thermodynamic property influenced by interfacial molecular interactions. This phase required transfer learning techniques alongside gradient-based hyperparameter tuning to optimize predictive capacity, achieving a high R² value of 0.912.

The overall pipeline facilitated rapid model inference and robust performance metrics, affirming the adaptability of transformer-based architectures in capturing physicochemical properties and advancing surface property prediction within the domain of cheminformatics and computational material science.Architected and pre-trained a RoBERTa model on over 70 million SMILES strings, employing masked language modeling to capture molecular embeddings with high-dimensional contextual dependencies.
