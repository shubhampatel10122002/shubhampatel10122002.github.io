Trained a RoBERTa model on 70M+ SMILES strings using masked language modeling. Achieved 98% accuracy in capturing molecular embeddings. Optimized transformer architecture to encode SMILES effectively. Adapted the model for surface tension prediction via transfer learning and gradient-based tuning, achieving an RÂ² of 0.912. The pipeline enabled rapid inference and robust performance, demonstrating transformers' utility in cheminformatics and computational material science.
