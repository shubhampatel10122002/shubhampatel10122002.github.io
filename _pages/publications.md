Trained a RoBERTa model on 70M+ SMILES strings using masked language modeling. Achieved 98% accuracy in capturing molecular embeddings. Optimized transformer architecture to encode SMILES effectively. Adapted the model for surface tension prediction via transfer learning and gradient-based tuning, achieving an R² of 0.912. The pipeline enabled rapid inference and robust performance, demonstrating transformers' utility in cheminformatics and computational material science.

Developed a foundational large language model (LLM) to predict multi-organ imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs), such as those derived from brain MRI, heart MRI, and eye OCT scans, based on genetic variations represented by sets of SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms). So, essentially model analyzes genetic data to estimate how certain genetic variations may influence observable characteristics in medical imaging across different organs.

This model incorporates data from the UK Biobank, which provides a comprehensive dataset linking individual-level SNP data with organ-specific imaging traits for the same subjects. Additionally, summary-level Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data is integrated into the model, allowing it to leverage known associations between SNPs and specific traits. GWAS data is extracted from resources like the GWAS Catalog, enhancing the model’s ability to identify and utilize SNP-IDP relationships.
By combining individual-level SNP data with broader GWAS information, the model aims to predict imaging-derived phenotypes with improved accuracy, offering insights into the potential genetic underpinnings of multi-organ characteristics. This foundational approach could support research in understanding how genetics shape organ structure and function as seen through imaging, potentially informing personalized medicine and further genetic studies
