<b>Object Tracking using Image Processing and Python</b> <br>
Advisor: [Prof. Ashish Chittora](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ashishc/profile)<br>
* Analyzed sample dataset by employing linear logistic regression and created a general linear model <br>
* Implemented mean subtraction and band pass filtering to remove noise in images<br>
* Employed TensorFlow framework to implement YOLOv3 model which identified presence, location and 
type of objects in a photograph <br>
* Utilized functionality of OpenCV and Python to access the metadata of videos<br>
* Employed Kernel-based tracking to sequentially analyze video frames to output the movements of target 
in such frames<br>

<b>Spirit Level Reaction Time Tester</b> <br>
Advisor: [Prof. K. R. Anupama](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/anupkr/profile)<br>
* Developed a tester that aimed to test the sobriety of a person by featuring two push-buttons (START and 
STOP) and nine LEDs on a bar graph as a part of the user interface<br>
* Setup random delays between the LEDs to measure the sobriety indicated by the number of LEDs lit up by 
the time user presses the STOP button<br>
* Prepared the prototype for the design and removed any bias from the system by generating a random 
number which is used to start the process by latching the value of the timer from an internal clock<br>
